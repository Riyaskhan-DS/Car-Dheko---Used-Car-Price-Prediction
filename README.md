## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **machine learning model** to predict the prices of **used cars** accurately. Leveraging historical data and various car features such as **make, model, year, fuel type**, and **transmission type**, the model aims to enhance the customer experience on **Car Dheko** by providing instant price predictions. The final solution includes an interactive **web application** developed with **Streamlit** that allows users to input car details and view price predictions in **real-time**.

## 📝 Problem Statement

### Objective:
Imagine you are a **data scientist** at **Car Dheko**. Your task is to improve the **customer experience** and streamline the **pricing process** by building an accurate and user-friendly **Streamlit tool** that predicts **used car prices** based on various features. The goal is to deploy this as an **interactive web application** for seamless use by both **customers** and **sales representatives**.

---

## 📊 Project Scope

We have access to a **historical dataset** of **used car prices** from **CarDekho**, covering various cities and attributes. As a data scientist, the task is to:
- Clean, preprocess, and transform this data.
- Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts used car prices based on input features.
- Deploy this model as a **web app** with **Streamlit** for **interactive use**.

---

## 🛠️ Project Approach

### 1️⃣ **Data Processing**
- **Import and Concatenate**: Import data from various cities and combine into a structured format.
- **Handle Missing Values**: Impute missing data with appropriate methods.
- **Standardize Data Formats**: Clean entries and ensure consistent data types.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Apply encoding techniques (one-hot, label encoding).
- **Normalize Numerical Features**: Scale features using techniques like Min-Max Scaling.
- **Remove Outliers**: Detect and remove outliers using IQR or Z-score analysis.

### 2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, etc.).
- **Data Visualization**: Use scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps to identify patterns.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify significant features that influence car prices.

### 3️⃣ **Model Development**
- **Train-Test Split**: Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 ratio).
- **Model Selection**: Test various algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- **Model Training**: Train selected models using cross-validation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize models using Grid Search/Random Search.

### 4️⃣ **Model Evaluation**
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate models using MAE, MSE, and R².
- **Model Comparison**: Compare models and select the best-performing one.

### 5️⃣ **Optimization**
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhance model with new/modified features.
- **Regularization**: Apply L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization to avoid overfitting.

### 6️⃣ **Deployment**
- **Streamlit Application**: Deploy model on a web app for real-time predictions.
- **User Interface**: Design a simple, intuitive UI with clear instructions.
